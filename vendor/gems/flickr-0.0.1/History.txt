== 1.0.5 2008-05-12

* 1 major change:
	* Updated and refactored Flickr::Group class and Flickr#groups method to work with current Flickr API. Flickr#groups now searches for given group, rather than groups.getActiveList (which no longer exists as Flickr API call)
* Minor enhancements:
	* Tweaked internals so new client instance isn't created each time new object (e.g. photo, user) is created
	* Improved test coverage
	
== 1.0.4 2008-05-11

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Added authentication facility as per current Flickr API
* 3 minor enhancements:
	* Improved test suite
	* Improved API for creating Flickr objects (old one still works)
	* Protected methods that are only used internally (e.g. request, request_url)

== 1.0.3 2008-04-18

* Various bugfixes:
	* User instantiation was broken (wrong number of params passed)
	* Instantiating photos failed in several places if single photo returned
	* Photosets#getInfo would always fail as the parameter name should be photoset_id, not photosets_id
	* Removed call to flickr.people.getOnlineList in Flickr#users as that call is no longer in the Flickr API
* Performance improvements:
	* Url and image source uri now generated without a call to the Flickr API, as per the Flickr API docs
